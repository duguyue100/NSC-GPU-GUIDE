# NSC GPU GUIDE

I started this project to help myself and my fellow master students then.
Although we were studying at a well-funded university, computation resources
for education were still scarce.
As far as I can tell, all machines listed in this project are retired.
And I'm glad that the students now have more channels to find these computation resources.

From now on, I primarily maintain this repository for a single purpose:
_have a no-pain installation guide in setting up a GPU machine for Deep Learning._

ðŸ‘‰ Click [here](./Admin-Guide.md) and follow the instruction.

If you have any questions on this guide, submit [issues](https://github.com/duguyue100/NSC-GPU-GUIDE/issues).

If you want to contribute, submit [pull request](https://github.com/duguyue100/NSC-GPU-GUIDE/pulls).

The GPU machines are intended to help NSC Master for managing computing
intensive applications.

## General Instructions

You can request the GPU resources if you are an (with priority)

1. INI NSC Master student
2. Master student who is working on a project at INI
3. INI member if you need the machine to run some jobs for a short time.

Please follow [this](./User-Guide.md) guide after you received username and password.

## Questions?

If you have any questions on machine, reach admin via email.

## Maintenance

The machines will be regularly updated by the administrator.
Emails will be sent to users 1 week prior to the update if there is a scheduled
maintenance.
